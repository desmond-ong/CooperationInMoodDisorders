## Data and Experiment

The data for the Trust Game study presented in the paper is in the [Analysis](https://github.com/desmond-ong/CooperationInMoodDisorders/blob/master/Analysis/) folder, and code for the experiment, conducted in Matlab with Psychtoolbox, is in the [Experiment](https://github.com/desmond-ong/CooperationInMoodDisorders/blob/master/Experiment/) folder.

## Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in [Analysis/TrustGameAnalysis.Rmd](https://github.com/desmond-ong/CooperationInMoodDisorders/blob/master/Analysis/TrustGameAnalysis.Rmd) (an R Markdown document).

The file contains all the R code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper.

The R markdown file can also be neatly formatted into a nice [HTML report](http://rawgit.com/desmond-ong/CooperationInMoodDisorders/master/Analysis/TrustGameAnalysis.html)
